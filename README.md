# Item Catalog (MOOC Providers Catalog)
###### Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
----

## Project Description

Item Catalog is a data-driven web application that provides a list of courses within a variety of categories (Massive Open Online Course Providers) as well as integrates a third-party user registration and authentication with Google or Facebook. The app has been developed using Flask framework and accesses a SQL database that populates categories and their items. Authenticated users have the ability to create, update and delete their own posted courses. This project is guided by [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Program](https://sa.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).


## Technologies Used

**Flask framework:** provides app routes to serve the HTTP endpoints and renders template to build the front-end pages
**OAuth:** implements Google/Facebook Login authentication and authorization systems for users
**SQLAlchemy:** communicating with the back-end database
**CRUD operations:** Manipulating database (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
**RESTful API endpoints:** return JSON files
